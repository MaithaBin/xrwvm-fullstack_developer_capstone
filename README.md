# Module 1
Module 1 was simply to add static page such as "About Us" page and "Contact Us" using HTML/CSS/Boostrap and run the Djapngo app on the deployment server. I downloaded images, added some text, and styled the pages.

# Module 2
This module was to create the user management system to allow users to register, login, and logout using React. The templete provided some build-in user management services to me. The tasks were to add the pathes to recoginize the front-end to Django app, to handle with a login/logout/register request, and to add register function.
